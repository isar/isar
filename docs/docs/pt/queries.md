# Queries

Querying is how you find records that match certain conditions, for example:

- Find all starred contacts
- Find distinct first names in contacts
- Delete all contacts that don't have the last name defined

Because queries are executed on the database and not in Dart, they're really fast. When you cleverly use indexes, you can improve the query performance even further. In the following, you'll learn how to write queries and how you can make them as fast as possible.

There are two different methods of filtering your records: Filters and where clauses. We'll start by taking a look at how filters work.

## Filters

Filters are easy to use and understand. Depending on the type of your properties, there are different filter operations available most of which have self-explanatory names.

Filters work by evaluating an expression for every object in the collection being filtered. If the expression resolves to `true`, Isar includes the object in the results. Filters do not affect the ordering of the results.

We'll use the following model for the examples below:

```dart
@collection
class Shoe {
  late int id;

  int? size;

  late String model;

  late bool isUnisex;
}
```

### Query conditions

Depending on the type of field, there are different conditions available.

| Condition | Description |
| ----------| ------------|
| `.equalTo(value)` | Matches values that are equal to the specified `value`. |
| `.between(lower, upper)` | Matches values that are between `lower` and `upper`. |
| `.greaterThan(bound)` | Matches values that are greater than `bound`. |
| `.lessThan(bound)` | Matches values that are less than `bound`. `null` values will be included by default because `null` is considered smaller than any other value. |
| `.isNull()` | Matches values that are `null`.|
| `.isNotNull()` | Matches values that are not `null`.|
| `.length()` | List, String and link length queries filter objects based on the number of elements in a list or link. |

Let's assume the database contains four shoes with sizes 39, 40, 46 and one with an un-set (`null`) size. Unless you perform sorting, the values will be returned sorted by id.

```dart

isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeLessThan(40)
  .findAll() // -> [39, null]

isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeLessThan(40, include: true)
  .findAll() // -> [39, null, 40]

isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeBetween(39, 46, includeLower: false)
  .findAll() // -> [40, 46]

```

### Logical operators

You can composite predicates using the following logical operators:

| Operator   | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `.and()`   | Evaluates to `true` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions evaluate to `true`. |
| `.or()`    | Evaluates to `true` if either expression evaluates to `true`. |
| `.xor()`   | Evaluates to `true` if exactly one expression evaluates to `true`. |
| `.not()`   | Negates the result of the following expression. |
| `.group()` | Group conditions and allow to specify order of evaluation. |

If you want to find all shoes in size 46, you can use the following query:

```dart
final result = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeEqualTo(46)
  .findAll();
```

If you want to use more than one condition, you can combine multiple filters using logical **and** `.and()`, logical **or** `.or()` and logical **xor** `.xor()`.

```dart
final result = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeEqualTo(46)
  .and() // Optional. Filters are implicitly combined with logical and.
  .isUnisexEqualTo(true)
  .findAll();
```

This query is equivalent to: `size == 46 && isUnisex == true`.

You can also group conditions using `.group()`:

```dart
final result = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeBetween(43, 46)
  .and()
  .group((q) => q
    .modelNameContains('Nike')
    .or()
    .isUnisexEqualTo(false)
  )
  .findAll()
```

This query is equivalent to `size >= 43 && size <= 46 && (modelName.contains('Nike') || isUnisex == false)`.

To negate a condition or group, use logical **not** `.not()`:

```dart
final result = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .not().sizeEqualTo(46)
  .and()
  .not().isUnisexEqualTo(true)
  .findAll();
```

This query is equivalent to `size != 46 && isUnisex != true`.

### String conditions

In addition to the query conditions above, String values offer a few more conditions you can use. Regex-like wildcards, for example, allow more flexibility in search.

| Condition            | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.startsWith(value)` | Matches string values that begins with provided `value`.          |
| `.contains(value)`   | Matches string values that contain the provided `value`.          |
| `.endsWith(value)`   | Matches string values that end with the provided `value`.         |
| `.matches(wildcard)` | Matches string values that match the provided `wildcard` pattern. |

**Case sensitivity**  
All string operations have an optional `caseSensitive` parameter that defaults to `true`.

**Wildcards:**  
A [wildcard string expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character) is a string that uses normal characters with two special wildcard characters:

- The `*` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
- The `?` wildcard matches any character.
  For example, the wildcard string `"d?g"` matches `"dog"`, `"dig"`, and `"dug"`, but not `"ding"`, `"dg"`, or `"a dog"`.

### Query modifiers

Sometimes it is necessary to build a query based on some conditions or for different values. Isar has a very powerful tool for building conditional queries:

| Modifier              | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `.optional(cond, qb)` | Extends the query only if the `condition` is `true`. This can be used almost anywhere in a query for example to conditionally sort or limit it. |
| `.anyOf(list, qb)`    | Extends the query for each value in `values` and combines the conditions using logical **or**. |
| `.allOf(list, qb)`    | Extends the query for each value in `values` and combines the conditions using logical **and**. |

In this example, we build a method that can find shoes with an optional filter:

```dart
Future<List<Shoe>> findShoes(Id? sizeFilter) {
  return isar.shoes.filter()
    .optional(
      sizeFilter != null, // only apply filter if sizeFilter != null
      (q) => q.sizeEqualTo(sizeFilter!),
    ).findAll();
}
```

If you want to find all shoes that have one of multiple shoe sizes, you can either write a conventional query or use the `anyOf()` modifier:

```dart
final shoes1 = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .sizeEqualTo(38)
  .or()
  .sizeEqualTo(40)
  .or()
  .sizeEqualTo(42)
  .findAll();

final shoes2 = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .anyOf(
    [38, 40, 42],
    (q, int size) => q.sizeEqualTo(size)
  ).findAll();

// shoes1 == shoes2
```

Query modifiers are especially useful when you want to build dynamic queries.

### Lists

Even lists can be queried:

```dart
class Tweet {
  late int id;

  String? text;

  List<String> hashtags = [];
}
```

You can query based on the list length:

```dart
final tweetsWithoutHashtags = await isar.tweets.filter()
  .hashtagsIsEmpty()
  .findAll();

final tweetsWithManyHashtags = await isar.tweets.filter()
  .hashtagsLengthGreaterThan(5)
  .findAll();
```

These are equivalent to the Dart code `tweets.where((t) => t.hashtags.isEmpty);` and `tweets.where((t) => t.hashtags.length > 5);`. You can also query based on list elements:

```dart
final flutterTweets = await isar.tweets.filter()
  .hashtagsElementEqualTo('flutter')
  .findAll();
```

This is equivalent to the Dart code `tweets.where((t) => t.hashtags.contains('flutter'));`.

### Embedded objects

Embedded objects are one of Isar's most useful features. They can be queried very efficiently using the same conditions available for top-level objects. Let's assume we have the following model:

```dart
@collection
class Car {
  late int id;

  Brand? brand;
}

@embedded
class Brand {
  String? name;

  String? country;
}
```

We want to query all cars that have a brand with the name `"BMW"` and the country `"Germany"`. We can do this using the following query:

```dart
final germanCars = await isar.cars.filter()
  .brand((q) => q
    .nameEqualTo('BMW')
    .and()
    .countryEqualTo('Germany')
  ).findAll();
```

Always try to group nested queries. The above query is more efficient than the following one. Even though the result is the same:

```dart
final germanCars = await isar.cars.filter()
  .brand((q) => q.nameEqualTo('BMW'))
  .and()
  .brand((q) => q.countryEqualTo('Germany'))
  .findAll();
```

### Links

If your model contains [links or backlinks](links) you can filter your query based on the linked objects or the number of linked objects.

:::warning
Keep in mind that link queries can be expensive because Isar needs to look up linked objects. Consider using embedded objects instead.
:::

```dart
@collection
class Teacher {
  late int id;

  late String subject;
}

@collection
class Student {
  late int id;

  late String name;

  final teachers = IsarLinks<Teacher>();
}
```

We want to find all students that have a math or English teacher:

```dart
final result = await isar.students.filter()
  .teachers((q) {
    return q.subjectEqualTo('Math')
      .or()
      .subjectEqualTo('English');
  }).findAll();
```

Link filters evaluate to `true` if at least one linked object matches the conditions.

Let's search for all students that have no teachers:
  
```dart
final result = await isar.students.filter().teachersLengthEqualTo(0).findAll();
```

or alternatively:

```dart
final result = await isar.students.filter().teachersIsEmpty().findAll();
```

## Where clauses

Where clauses are a very powerful tool, but it can be a little challenging to get them right.

In contrast to filters where clauses use the indexes you defined in the schema to check the query conditions. Querying an index is a lot faster than filtering each record individually.

➡️ Learn more: [Indexes](indexes)

:::tip
As a basic rule, you should always try to reduce the records as much as possible using where clauses and do the remaining filtering using filters.
:::

You can only combine where clauses using logical **or**. In other words, you can sum multiple where clauses together, but you can't query the intersection of multiple where clauses.

Let's add indexes to the shoe collection:

```dart
@collection
class Shoe with IsarObject {
  late int id;

  @Index()
  Id? size;

  late String model;

  @Index(composite: [CompositeIndex('size')])
  late bool isUnisex;
}
```

There are two indexes. The index on `size` allows us to use where clauses like `.sizeEqualTo()`. The composite index on `isUnisex` allows where clauses like `isUnisexSizeEqualTo()`. But also `isUnisexEqualTo()` because you can always use any prefix of an index.

We can now rewrite the query from before that finds unisex shoes in size 46 using the composite index. This query will be a lot faster than the previous one:

```dart
final result = isar.shoes.where()
  .isUnisexSizeEqualTo(true, 46)
  .findAll();
```

Where clauses have two more superpowers: They give you "free" sorting and a super fast distinct operation.

### Combining where clauses and filters

Remember the `shoes.filter()` queries? It's actually just a shortcut for `shoes.where().filter()`. You can (and should) combine where clauses and filters in the same query to use the benefits of both:

```dart
final result = isar.shoes.where()
  .isUnisexEqualTo(true)
  .filter()
  .modelContains('Nike')
  .findAll();
```

The where clause is applied first to reduce the number of objetcs to be filtered. Then the filter is applied to the remaining objetcs.

## Sorting

You can define how the results should be sorted when executing the query using the `.sortBy()`, `.sortByDesc()`, `.thenBy()` and `.thenByDesc()` methods.

To find all shoes sorted by model name in ascending order and size in descending order without using an index:

```dart
final sortedShoes = isar.shoes.filter()
  .sortByModel()
  .thenBySizeDesc()
  .findAll();
```

Sorting many results can be expensive, especially since sorting happens before offset and limit. The sorting methods above never make use of indexes. Luckily, we can again use where clause sorting and make our query lightning-fast even if we need to sort a million objects.

### Where clause sorting

If you use a **single** where clause in your query, the results are already sorted by the index. That's a big deal!

Let's assume we have shoes in sizes `[43, 39, 48, 40, 42, 45]` and we want to find all shoes with a size greater than `42` and also have them sorted by size:

```dart
final bigShoes = isar.shoes.where()
  .sizeGreaterThan(42) // also sorts the results by size
  .findAll(); // -> [43, 45, 48]
```

As you can see, the result is sorted by the `size` index. If you want to reverse the where clause sort order, you can set `sort` to `Sort.desc`:

```dart
final bigShoesDesc = await isar.shoes.where(sort: Sort.desc)
  .sizeGreaterThan(42)
  .findAll(); // -> [48, 45, 43]
```

Sometimes you don't want to use a where clause but still benefit from the implicit sorting. You can use the `any` where clause:

```dart
final shoes = await isar.shoes.where()
  .anySize()
  .findAll(); // -> [39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 48]
```

If you use a composite index, the results are sorted by all fields in the index.

:::tip
If you need the results to be sorted, consider using an index for that purpose. Especially if you work with `offset()` and `limit()`.
:::

Sometimes it's not possible or useful to use an index for sorting. For such cases, you should use indexes to reduce the number of resulting entries as much as possible.

## Unique values

To return only entries with unique values, use the distinct predicate. For example, to find out how many different shoe models you have in your Isar database:

```dart
final shoes = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .distinctByModel()
  .findAll();
```

You can also chain multiple distinct conditions to find all shoes with distinct model-size combinations:

```dart
final shoes = await isar.shoes.filter()
  .distinctByModel()
  .distinctBySize()
  .findAll();
```

Only the first result of each distinct combination is returned. You can use where clauses and sort operations to control it.

### Where clause distinct

If you have a non-unique index, you may want to get all of its distinct values. You could use the `distinctBy` operation from the previous section, but it's performed after sorting and filters, so there is some overhead.  
If you only use a single where clause, you can instead rely on the index to perform the distinct operation.

```dart
final shoes = await isar.shoes.where(distinct: true)
  .anySize()
  .findAll();
```

:::tip
In theory, you could even use multiple where clauses for sorting and distinct. The only restriction is that those where clauses are not overlapping and use the same index. For correct sorting, they also need to be applied in sort order. Be very careful if you rely on this!
:::

## Offset & Limit

It's often a good idea to limit the number of results from a query for lazy list views. You can do so by setting a `limit()`:

```dart
final firstTenShoes = await isar.shoes.where()
  .limit(10)
  .findAll();
```

By setting an `offset()` you can also paginate the results of your query.

```dart
final firstTenShoes = await isar.shoes.where()
  .offset(20)
  .limit(10)
  .findAll();
```

Since instantiating Dart objects is often the most expensive part of executing a query, it is a good idea only to load the objects you need.

## Execution order

Isar executes queries always in the same order:

1. Traverse primary or secondary index to find objects (apply where clauses)
2. Filter objects
3. Sort results
4. Apply distinct operation
5. Offset & limit results
6. Return results

## Query operations

In the previous examples, we used `.findAll()` to retrieve all matching objects. There are more operations available, however:

| Operation        | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.findFirst()`   | Retreive only the first matching object or `null` if none matches.                                                  |
| `.findAll()`     | Retreive all matching objects.                                                                                      |
| `.count()`       | Count how many objects match the query.                                                                             |
| `.deleteFirst()` | Delete the first matching object from the collection.                                                               |
| `.deleteAll()`   | Delete all matching objects from the collection.                                                                    |
| `.build()`       | Compile the query to reuse it later. This saves the cost to build a query if you want to execute it multiple times. |

## Property queries

If you are only interested in the values of a single property, you can use a property query. Just build a regular query and select a property:

```dart
List<String> models = await isar.shoes.where()
  .modelProperty()
  .findAll();

List<int> sizes = await isar.shoes.where()
  .sizeProperty()
  .findAll();
```

Using only a single property saves time during deserialization. Property queries also work for embedded objects and lists.

## Aggregation

Isar supports aggregating the values of a property query. The following aggregation operations are available:

| Operation    | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.min()`     | Finds the minimum value or `null` if none matches.             |
| `.max()`     | Finds the maximum value or `null` if none matches.             |
| `.sum()`     | Sums all values.                                               |
| `.average()` | Calculates the average of all values or `NaN` if none matches. |

Using aggregations is vastly faster than finding all matching objects and performing the aggregation manually.

## Dynamic queries

:::danger
This section is most likely not relevant to you. It is discouraged to use dynamic queries unless you absolutely need to (and you rarely do).
:::

All the examples above used the QueryBuilder and the generated static extension methods. Maybe you want to create dynamic queries or a custom query language (like the Isar Inspector). In that case, you can use the `buildQuery()` method:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `whereClauses`  | The where clauses of the query.                                                             |
| `whereDistinct` | Whether where clauses should return distinct values (only useful for single where clauses). |
| `whereSort`     | The traverse order of the where clauses (only useful for single where clauses).             |
| `filter`        | The filter to apply to the results.                                                         |
| `sortBy`        | A list of properties to sort by.                                                            |
| `distinctBy`    | A list of properties to distinct by.                                                        |
| `offset`        | The offset of the results.                                                                  |
| `limit`         | The maximum number of results to return.                                                    |
| `property`      | If non-null, only the values of this property are returned.                                 |

Let's create a dynamic query:

```dart
final shoes = await isar.shoes.buildQuery(
  whereClauses: [
    WhereClause(
      indexName: 'size',
      lower: [42],
      includeLower: true,
      upper: [46],
      includeUpper: true,
    )
  ],
  filter: FilterGroup.and([
    FilterCondition(
      type: ConditionType.contains,
      property: 'model',
      value: 'nike',
      caseSensitive: false,
    ),
    FilterGroup.not(
      FilterCondition(
        type: ConditionType.contains,
        property: 'model',
        value: 'adidas',
        caseSensitive: false,
      ),
    ),
  ]),
  sortBy: [
    SortProperty(
      property: 'model',
      sort: Sort.desc,
    )
  ],
  offset: 10,
  limit: 10,
).findAll();
```

The following query is equivalent:

```dart
final shoes = await isar.shoes.where()
  .sizeBetween(42, 46)
  .filter()
  .modelContains('nike', caseSensitive: false)
  .not()
  .modelContains('adidas', caseSensitive: false)
  .sortByModelDesc()
  .offset(10).limit(10)
  .findAll();
```
